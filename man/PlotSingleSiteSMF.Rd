\title{Plot SMF data at single site}
\usage{
PlotSingleSiteSMF(
  Methylation,
  RegionOfInterest,
  ShowContext = FALSE,
  TFBSs = NULL,
  SNPs = NULL,
  SortingBins = NULL,
  SortedReads = NULL,
  sorting.strategy = "None"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Methylation}{Context methylation object as returned by CallContextMethylation function}

\item{RegionOfInterest}{GRanges interval to plot}

\item{ShowContext}{TRUE or FALSE (default). Causes the genomic context of the plotted cytosines to be displayed as the dot shape}

\item{TFBSs}{GRanges object of transcription factor binding sites to include in the plot. Assumed to be already subset. Also assumed that the tf names are under the column "TF"}

\item{SNPs}{GRanges object of SNPs to visualize. Assumed to be already subset. Assumed to have the reference and alternative sequences respectively under the columns "R" and "A"}

\item{SortingBins}{GRanges object of sorting bins (absolute) coordinate to visualize}

\item{SortedReads}{Defaults to NULL, in which case will plot unsorted reads. Sorted reads object as returned by SortReads function or "HC" to perform hierarchical clustering}

\item{sorting.strategy}{One of "classical" (default), "custom", "hierarchical.clustering" or "None". Determines how to display reads. For details check documentation from PlotSM function.}
