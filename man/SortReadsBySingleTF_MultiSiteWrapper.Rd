\title{Convenience wrapper to sort single molecule according to TFBS clusters at multiple sites in the genome}
\usage{
SortReadsBySingleTF_MultiSiteWrapper(
  sampleFile,
  samples,
  genome,
  coverage = 20,
  ConvRate.thr = NULL,
  CytosinesToMask = NULL,
  TFBSs,
  max_interTF_distance = 1e+05,
  max_window_width = 5e+06,
  min_cluster_width = 600,
  fix.window.size = FALSE,
  max.window.size = NULL,
  sorting_coverage = 30,
  bins = list(c(-35, -25), c(-15, 15), c(25, 35)),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampleFile}{QuasR pointer file}

\item{samples}{samples to use, from the SampleName field of the sampleFile}

\item{genome}{BSgenome}

\item{coverage}{coverage threshold as integer for least number of reads to cover a cytosine for it to be carried over in the analysis. Defaults to 20.}

\item{ConvRate.thr}{Convesion rate threshold. Double between 0 and 1, defaults to NULL. To skip this filtering step, set to NULL. For more information, check out the details section.}

\item{CytosinesToMask}{CytosinesToMask object. Passed to MaskSNPs function}

\item{TFBSs}{GRanges object of transcription factor binding sites coordinates}

\item{max_interTF_distance}{maximum distance between two consecutive TFBSs for them to be grouped in the same window}

\item{max_window_width}{upper limit to window width. This value should be adjusted according to the user's system as it determines the amount of memory used in the later context methylation call}

\item{min_cluster_width}{lower limit to window width. Corresponds to the scenario when a window contains a single TFBS.}

\item{fix.window.size}{defaults to FALSE. Passed to Create_MethylationCallingWindows function.}

\item{max.window.size}{defaults to NULL. Passed to Create_MethylationCallingWindows function.}

\item{sorting_coverage}{integer. Minimum number of reads covering all sorting bins for sorting to be performed. Defaults to 30.}

\item{bins}{list of 3 relative bin coordinates. Defaults to list(c(-35,-25), c(-15,15), c(25,35)).
bins[[1]] represents the upstream bin, with coordinates relative to the start of the most upstream TFBS.
bins[[2]] represents all the TFBS bins, with coordinates relative to the center of each TFBS.
bins[[3]] represents the downstream bin, with coordinates relative to the end of the most downstream TFBS.}

\item{cores}{number of cores to use for parallel processing of multiple Methylation Calling Windows (i.e. groupings of adjecent TFBS clusters)}
}
\value{
list where [[1]] is the TFBSs GRanges object describing coordinates TFBSs used to sort single molecules
                   [[2]] is a list of SortedReads nested per TFBS_cluster and sample
                   [[3]] is a tibble reporting the count (and frequency) of reads per state, sample and TFBS cluster
}
\description{
The function starts from a list of single TFBSs, arranges them into clusters, calls methylation at the interested sites and outputs sorted reads
